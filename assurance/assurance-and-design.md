# Design assurance

> DfE Architecture is moving to a more profession-led model. This content is under review. Contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) for more information.

## In-line assurance

We have different ways of delivering services in DfE. How we assure technical design meets the necessary standards needs to be flexible.
We need to ensure we're doing the right things (governance) and doing things right (assurance). And not slowing down delivery in the process.

The SRO or Service Owner (usually a Deputy Director) is accountable for all delivery within their service, programme or division. They rely on the advice of technical experts within their multi-disciplinary teams and portfolios when taking ownership of key technical designs for their domain - the 'in-line' assurance model.

Groups of accountable people (such as the Digital and Technology Senior Leadership Team or Service Owner community) are collectively accountable for all key technical decisions across the organisation, ensuring all cross-divisional or cross-functional impacts are considered.

We encourage an 'in-line' assurance model for architecture and technical design. You can read more about the evolving in-line assurance model and where this has been adopted or is being tested.

 ## Design assurance in delivery teams

 We expect architectures will emerge and evolve over time, as services themselves change based on emerging user needs and other drivers, such as policy changes.

 This requires ongoing and continuous review of architecture and technical design, to ensure services are being built sustainably and consistently, both across the service area and also the wider organisation.

 Embedded architects work closely with their delivery teams to facilitate this, alongside product managers, developers and other people. They also work alongside their lead/principal architect, who may cut across multiple services, to ensure breadth and consistency in their designs.

 Architects have access to a plethora of design skills and experience from across professional communities in DfE. They can use [architecture community meet-ups](https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/capability/architecture-capability-framework/#community) to ask for help with design problems, or ask the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) to help facilitate a [peer review](###Peer-review) of their design. Many permanent architects have professional objectives that include supporting others in the community with peer review and preparation for service assessment.

 ## Things to help you

 ### Peer review

 The architecture profession can help you find the right people to review your design and provide helpful, constructive advice, whatever your stage of delivery. This could be early on when you're thinking about the problem space and options, or later on, when you have physical design.

 Typically, you'd have a design and some narrative documented to share in advance of the session - this could be in a form of a passport, design pack or links to technical documentation on your repository/wiki. This gives reviewers the opportunity to understand the context and think of any burning questions about your design beforehand.

 During the session, you'll walk through key points of your design, seek and discuss feedback. It should be an open, honest and constructive conversation, amongst trusted peers. You'll be expected to make notes yourself and summarise these (and any actions) back to the group. For particularly large or complex designs, the profession may be able to provide facilitation/secretariat support.

 After the session, the profession will record any significant or cross-cutting architecture decisions and actions, and follow these up.

 ### The role of an architect through the product lifecycle

 | **Lifecycle phase:** | **Planning/Inception** | **Discovery** | **Alpha** | **Beta** (private/public) | **Live** |
 | ----| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
 | **Purpose of each phase:**| What is the problem space? Is there a problem to solve? | What is the problem? How big is it? Can we solve it? | What are our risky assumptions? How can we release value early? | What should we build first and is it adding value? |How can we continually add value to the service? |
| **Role of the architect:** | Problem framing; Stakeholder mapping; Input to business case | Problem statement; Goals and drivers; Conceptual views; Business/technical capability mapping; Early option thinking | Solution prototyping; Capability/service/application views; Data architecture; Design assumptions and constraints; Options considered/tested | High > low level design: application, data, integration, hosting, security; Infrastructure/network topology, Disaster recovery, logging, auditing, error handling; Managing the service and support; Architecture/design decisions | Continual improvement; Relationships with suppliers; Learning/future recommendations |

## Technical show and Tells

It may be more appropriate for you to bring architects and team members together for a technical Show and Tell. These are a great way to provide support, challenge and design assurance in a less formal setting

Contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) to get a slot at a community meet-up.

## Design pack

- [Design pack, with example diagrams](../documents/design-pack.docx)
- [Design pack, text only](../documents/design-pack-just-text.docx)

These templates can be used as a guide when creating a design. Whether various elements are applicable will vary dependent on your particular circumstances, so treat this as a set of helpful things to consider as you draft your design. Of course, you're very welcome to use the document format as it stands, but many architects will want to replicate elements in their own service wikis and repositories.

Broadly, a design pack provides an overview of the scope, deliverables and complexities of implementing change in a service landscape. It should provide enough information for all interested or required parties to understand the architecture and design changes needed and any new or improved functionality that the change will deliver. It should be useful in any delivery context, be that a digital, data or technology service.

Above all, a design pack should move the design process forward, enabling effective review and assurance of impending change. It should be a living, breathing artefact that is continually updated by the project or service team, in collaboration with a lead architect.

It is important to remember that this document should be used as a guide and adapted as necessary.
