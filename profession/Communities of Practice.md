# Introduction
There is a thriving architecture community in DfE. We meet up monthly, to 'show and tell' good things that are happening in architecture and hear from wider Government, private sector, relevant suppliers and vendors on new, innovative solutions. And to just chat and share knowledge. You don't have to be an architect to join in - we often hear updates from business areas and those interested in what we're doing. If you want to get involved or have something to share, drop us a line in the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk).

## Communities
There are several architecture-related communities within the DfE, providing opportunities for sharing knowledge, seeking advice, providing guidance and exchanging ideas. For more information, contact the named community lead, using the table below:

| Community | Lead architect |
| ----------| ---------- |
| Technical Architecture | Andy Emley|
| Architecture in Data Science| Pete Holding/Stuart Baillie|
| Common technology themes | Pete Dingwall |
| Data Architecture | Tafseer Nisa |

## Meet ups, resources and channels
### Meet ups
We have an open invite monthly meet up for all architects across DfE and those with an interest in architecture (civil servants and contractors). The meet up provides opportunity to discuss and share all things architecture and design and usually includes:

- **Regular internal and external speakers** sharing their experiences from the front line of Architecture
- **Lean coffee** - we vote and talk about any issues of the day
- **Discuss common challenges in architecture** such as technical debt, patterns, roadmaps and strategy

Hosting of the meeting and topcs is shared by the community and rotates round

### Resources
As well as the communities previously mentioned, there are a range of resources available, for knowledge sharing, seeking advice exchanging ideas and providing guidance. These include our Architecture Toolkit and several cross-Government forums:
