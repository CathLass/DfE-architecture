# Architecture profession 

## What we do and how we help

Architects in DfE, design and deliver services that provide outcomes for end users and the Department. They are responsible for the technical quality of the products and services we deliver, thinking innovatively and bringing a broader perspective to service delivery.

Architecture in DfE follows a profession-led model. Architects are embedded in service delivery teams, portfolios or domains and are supported by the architecture profession.

The architecture profession:

- builds architecture capability across DfE, providing a capability framework, supporting recruitment, career pathways and professional development opportunities
- sets architecture and technical design standards, providing guidance and a proportionate assurance framework
- builds architecture and technical design communities, facilitating regular meet-ups with opportunities for all to share and learn

There is a large community of permanent and contingent architects across the Department, plus commercial frameworks to help fulfil your needs.

If you're looking for architecture support for your project, you should discuss your needs with your Architecture Lead.

## Architecture Leads

Architecture Leads work within a DfE group or portfolio of work (e.g. ESFA, EYSG or SCMD). They work closely with DDaT business partners and other DDaT specialists to support, signpost and help join-up delivery.

They:

- assist, advise and guide programmes and projects, ensuring alignment with:
  - technical strategies, including reuse of common components, patterns and standards
  - architectural principles
  - architecture governance and design assurance
- should be engaged from idea conception and throughout delivery
- can help identify architects and resources needed to support delivery:
  - guiding idea formation and supporting recruitment of the right architects to meet those needs Â 
  - working with a service delivery team to align with architecture principles and governance,
  - helping identify commonality across the enterprise and finding the right solutions
