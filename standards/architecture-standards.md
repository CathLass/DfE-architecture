# Architecture standards

Like all UK Government departments, architects in DfE are guided by the [UK Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) and the [Government Functional Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards).

Architects in DfE should also be familiar with our [Enterprise Architecture principles](), [Technical Architecture principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/architecture/#technical-architecture-principles) and [Enterprise Data Architecture principles](). Architects involved in developing software should also be familiar with our [coding principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/coding-principles/) and [front-end development principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/frontend-development-principles/).

## Standards in DfE

Various technical standards exist (or are in development) that are relevant to architecture work in DfE. Architects will be guided by and may need to apply the following standard(s) in their work:

- [API standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/guides/api-guidance/#dfe-api-standards)
- [Software development standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/), including things like [naming things](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/naming-things/), [storing source code](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/storing-source-code/) and [licensing software](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/licencing-software-or-code/)
- [Data policies and standards](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00085/SitePages/DfE-Data-Policies.aspx)
- Infrastructure and network standards (in development)
- [Information security standards](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/security-assurance.aspx)
- Guidance on [meeting accessibility standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#meeting-accessibility-requirements) and the [technical standard for digital accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-website-and-mobile-application-accessibility-monitoring#technical-standard-for-digital-accessibility)

## Standard owners

Every standard has an owner. This is typically a technical lead in a particular domain.

A standard owner's responsibilities are to:

* Ensure the standard is published and available to all
* Ensure the standard is fit-for-purpose across DfE
* Consult (or facilitate consultation) with stakeholders impacted by the standard
* Ensure the standard is iterated and updated in the architecture repository

You can see a list of standard owners [here](#).

## Application of standards

The application of standards is generally assured through co-design in teams, and peer review in architecture and technical communities. There are likely to be additional checks that standards have been met during service assessment. Occasionally, there may be spot checks to ensure consistent and appropriate application of standards.

Architects are responsible for architecture and design decisions in their respective portfolio, service or domain. They should be confident in representing these in their respective communities and any DfE governance or assurance forums. Typically, design decisions are recorded as [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../architecture-documentation/#architecture-decision-records) and stored alongside other design and technical documentation (ideally in Github).
