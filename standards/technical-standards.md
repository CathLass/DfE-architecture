# Technical standards in DfE

Like all UK Government departments, architects in DfE are guided by the [UK Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) and the [Government Functional Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards).

Architects in DfE should also be familiar with our [Enterprise Architecture principles](../principles/enterprise-architecture-principles.md), [Technical Architecture principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/architecture/#technical-architecture-principles) and [Enterprise Data Architecture principles](../principles/enterprise-data-architecture-principles.md). 

Architects involved in developing software should also be familiar with our [coding principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/coding-principles/) and [front-end development principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/frontend-development-principles/).

## Standards in development

Some standards [have already been published](#published-technical-standards), but require work to make them fit-for-purpose across DfE. Most standards do not yet exist or are in development.

The architecture team are co-ordinating the creation of technical standards in DfE. The following list shows proposed technical standards - derived from the Technology Reference Model and group by component - and who owns them.

We're working with teams to prioritise and create the standards that will provide the most value to delivery teams and DfE. As standards are agreed and published, they will be updated on this page.

## Published standards

Whilst technical standards are being developed, architects may also find the following guidance useful in their work:

- [API standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/guides/api-guidance/#dfe-api-standards)
- [Software development standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/), including things like [naming things](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/naming-things/), [storing source code](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/storing-source-code/) and [licensing software](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/licencing-software-or-code/)
- [Data policies and standards](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00085/SitePages/DfE-Data-Policies.aspx)
- [Information security standards](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/security-assurance.aspx)
- Guidance on [meeting accessibility standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#meeting-accessibility-requirements) and the [technical standard for digital accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-website-and-mobile-application-accessibility-monitoring#technical-standard-for-digital-accessibility)

## Standard owners

Every standard has an owner. This is typically a technical lead in a particular domain.

A standard owner's responsibilities are to:

* Ensure the standard is published and available to all
* Ensure the standard is fit-for-purpose across DfE
* Consult (or facilitate consultation) with stakeholders impacted by the standard
* Ensure the standard is iterated and updated in the architecture repository

## Application of standards

The application of standards is generally assured through co-design in teams, and peer review in architecture and technical communities. There will also be checks that standards have been met during service assessment. Occasionally, there may be spot checks to ensure consistent and appropriate application of DfE technical standards.

Architects are responsible for architecture and design decisions in their respective portfolio, service or domain. They should be confident in representing these in their respective communities and any DfE governance or assurance forums. Typically, design decisions are recorded as [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../architecture-documentation/#architecture-decision-records) and stored alongside other design and technical documentation (ideally in Github).
